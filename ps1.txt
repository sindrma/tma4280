Introduction to supercomputers

Problem set 1

Exercise 1
	We should include 7 digits.

Exercise 2
	4.25 = 100.01 = 1.0001 * 2^2
	S = 0
	E - B = 2
	E = B + 2 = 127 + 2 = 129
	E = 129 = 128 + 1 = 10000001

Exercise 3
	2^-52 = 2.22044..*10^-16.
	We therefore have 16 digits of accuracy using double precision.

Exercise 4
	Use two loops where the innerloop goes up to approximatly 10^9

Exercise 5
	Vector sum: 2n

	Matrix-vector product: n*(n + (n-1)) = n*(2n -1)

Exercise 6
